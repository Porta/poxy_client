{"name":"Poxy client","tagline":"Ruby client for Poxy, a weird service to capture requests, and do stuff with them.","body":"# poxy_client\r\n\r\n[Poxy](http://poxy.ws) is a web application that captures HTTP requests to let you do fun stuff with them.\r\n\r\nFun things like proxying, forwarding, emailing and some sort of processing (soon!).\r\n\r\nIn order to use it first you'll need to [create an account](http://poxy.ws/register) into the site.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Bundler\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'poxy_client'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\n\r\n    $ gem install poxy_client\r\n\r\n## API Blueprint and Documentation\r\n\r\nCourtesy of the great service [Apiary.io](http://apiary.io/), here it is:\r\n[http://docs.poxy.apiary.io/](http://docs.poxy.apiary.io/)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways to use the client.\r\n\r\nThe distribution includes an executable file that you can use. It requires a .config file.\r\n\r\nOr, you can implement your own client suited to your particular needs. Take a look at the executable file, or check the code documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Executable\r\n\r\nIn the /lib folder of the distribution, there's a file named {file:bin/poxyd.rb poxyd.rb} which you can run from the commandline.\r\n\r\nIt requires a mandatory config file (included in the distribution you'll find a sample one, here {file:poxy.conf ./poxy.conf}).\r\n\r\nYou can use that as a start (it points to a test endpoint in the poxy api).\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can pass a -d parameter, and the executable will run as a daemon.\r\n\r\nSample run:\r\n\t\r\n\t$ ruby poxyd.rb -c poxy.conf -d\r\n\r\nBeing poxy.conf a config file with your own API and Bucket keys.\r\n\r\n### Custom implementation\r\n\r\nThe code for {PoxyClient poxy_client} it's pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\nThe {PoxyClient.perform perform} method encapsulates the 3 important operations the client does.\r\n\r\n#### Retrieve\r\n\r\n#### Parse\r\n\r\n#### Repeat\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4.
